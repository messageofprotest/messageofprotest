## Disabled Google Analytics

This can be useful to avoid polluting the click tracking.  It's automatically disabled when deving on local host, but now it can also be disabled when visiting the main site from your browser.

To disable, navigate here: https://messageofprotest.com/#/?enable_google_analytics=false

It will stay disabled, and as long is it is disabled you will be notified.

To re-enable: https://messageofprotest.com/#/?enable_google_analytics=true
